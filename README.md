Conference-CheckList
===
## Will you be attending a conference soon? Here's a checklist to help you get ready for that event!

# What is this?
A checklist I created so I don't forget anything and fully enjoy my Microsoft Ignite experience.

# Why is this important?
If you're heading to a conference, there's a lot to do prior to taking your seat with thousands of fellows in front of Satya Nadella who will kick-off that wonderful, one-time-in-a-year event.

This checklist is a compilation of my recommendations based on my experience. I use it myself and I thought that it might be useful to someone else.

# Okay, Show me the list...
The Ignite checklist is available [here](./ignite-checklist.md)

See you at Ignite!
