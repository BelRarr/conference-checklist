# Prior to the event

-  [ ] Pack your (nerdiest) clothes
    - You're free to be as nerdy as you like!
    - Pack light (the lighter, the better).
- [ ] Bring clothes suitable for Orlando's weather
    - The expected temp in Orlando for September is around 90 Fahrenheit (32C)
- [ ] Bring good walking shoes because you'll do a lot of walking
    - The convention center is very big
    - Theme parks (Disney/Universal) are very big too
- [ ] Bring a large backpack 'cause there will be a lot of goodies ! :)
    - You'll go back home with a heavier luggage than when you arrived...
    - Did I mention to pack light? ;)
- [ ] Make sure your passport is still valid (if attending a conference in a foreign country)
    - If you need a Visa, make sure you have it and it's valid
- [ ] Bring your business cards
- [ ] Make sure you have enough money (there will be side expenses, believe me!)
- [ ] Make space in your phone (yes, you'll take a looooot of pictures :D )
- [ ] Downloand the Microsoft Ignite mobile app [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/msft-events/id1402818768?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.events)
    - It will be your best companion during the conference
- [ ] Explore sessions and create your custom-tailored schedule
    - The conference center is very big, so I recommend to schedule more than one session for a given time slot. That way, you'll have a backup plan if the first session of your choice is either full or way to far to reach it before it begins.
    - Use the [Schedule Builder](https://myignite.techcommunity.microsoft.com/sessions) for that matter.
    - Select all sessions that interest you at first, then filter the conflicting ones. Remember to have 2 or 3 sessions for the same time slot as mentioned above.
- [ ] Book a hotel proposed on the Microsoft Ignite website (preferably)
    - that way, you can take the shuttle from and to the conference center for free.
    - You may consider booking an Airbnb, if you don't find a hotel that works for you.
- [ ] If you're an MVP, don't forget to visit the MVP Lounge
- [ ] If you're not an MVP, don't forget to visit the MVP Lounge
    - There are great people to meet, who are willing to share their enthusiasm, energy and knowledge with you!
- [ ] Have a question on a specific Microsoft technology, product or service? There'll certainly be a booth where you can get it answered
    - Get your questions ready
    - Locate the best booth to ask for them (use the convention center's map)
- [ ] Reconnect with people you've met in previous edition of the Microsoft Ignite event and let them know that you'll be there


# During the event
- [ ] Don't miss the opening Keynote
    - It has some magical and inspirational feeling
- [ ] Have fun! (this is the number one recommendation)
    - You've worked hard to get there so enjoy!
- [ ] Talk to people, make new friends or new connections
- [ ] Tweet your experience with the #MSIgnite hashtag
- [ ] Allow time to visit booths
    - There's a lot of interesting things to discover there.
- [ ] Allow time to enjoy the city
    - You don't have to head to your hotel right after the last session of the day finishes ;)
    - There's a lot to see in Orlando (did I mention that there'd be side expenses?)
- [ ] Do not forget the "Celebration event" (Thursday evening)
    - So much fun packed in one evening, you won't believe it!
- [ ] Consider attending Theater (THR) sessions
    - These are short-condensed-very-informative sessions that really worth the shot
    - Last year, these sessions weren't recorded (unlike "regular" sessions); So, it might be your only chance to attend them!
- [Â ] You may be able to take note
    - Keep in mind that Microsoft will provide a recording and the slide decks for most of the sessions (with exception to the THR sessions)
    - [Jonathan McKinney](https://twitter.com/ucomsgeek) suggests that you use a Jabra Speak 410/510 (or similar devce) with OneNote. If you have the Bluetooth version you might even get permission to put it up near where the speaker is speaking. Check out [his blog post on this topic](http://blog.lyncdialog.com/2012/04/so-you-want-to-be-lync-master.html).


# During the Celebration party
- [ ] Be on time at the identified departure location at your hotel
- [ ] Keep in mind that there are fixed departure and return time slots
- [ ] Bring only the absolutely-required stuff
    - That way, the security check at the entrance will be faster, which means more time for fun!
    - Also because some attractions will require that you leave your stuff away for safety reasons
    - Also because it's better to carry food and drinks that backpacks and such stuff ;)
- [ ] Tweet your experience with the #MSIgnite hashtag


# After the event
- [ ] Take time to digest all what you've seen/heard/experienced/learned
- [ ] Blog about it or share it on your favourite social media
- [ ] Hold a local meetup event to share your experience with those who didn't have your luck
    - Yeah, it's okay to say that you had a wonderful time there! :D
- [ ] Put what you've learn into practice
    - This could lead you to create something new, to contribute to an open-source project, present at a conference or a local event, write a blog, or else (let me know).
